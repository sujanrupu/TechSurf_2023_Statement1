## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally. To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Installation

Setting up development environment (for VS Code Users)
  
  Install The Live server extension on your native VS Code: [Link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
  (Helps you to run the live project and not reload any changes that you make in it)
  
  Set up the project directory:
  

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to Project Directory
   ```sh
   cd <project-name>
   ```
3. Open VS Code from terminal
   ```sh
   code .
   ```
